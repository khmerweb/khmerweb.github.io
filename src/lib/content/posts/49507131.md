<p>From Playwright team</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:21px;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Playwright tests can be run on any CI provider. This guide covers one way of running tests on GitHub using GitHub Actions. If you would like to learn more, or how to configure other CI providers, check out our detailed doc on Continuous Integration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:21px;"><strong>Setting up GitHub Actions</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When installing Playwright using the VS Code extension or with npm init playwright@latest, you are given the option to add a GitHub Actions workflow. This creates a playwright.yml file inside a .github/workflows folder containing everything you need so that your tests run on each push and pull request into the main/master branch. Here's how that file looks:</p><pre><code class="js javascript js-code">// .github/workflows/playwright.yml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, master ]
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: lts/*
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Install Playwright Browsers
      run: npx playwright install --with-deps
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30</code></pre><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The workflow performs these steps:</p><ol><li>Clone your repository</li><li>Install Node.js</li><li>Install NPM Dependencies</li><li>Install Playwright Browsers</li><li>Run Playwright tests</li><li>Upload HTML report to the GitHub UI</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:21px;"><strong>Create a Repo and Push to GitHub</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have your GitHub Actions workflow setup, then all you need to do is Create a repo on GitHub or push your code to an existing repository. Follow the instructions on GitHub and don't forget to initialize a git repository using the git init command so you can add, commit, and push your code.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423254-d2735278-a2ab-4d63-bb99-48d8e5e447bc.png"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:21px;"><strong>Opening the Workflows</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Click on the Actions tab to see the workflows. Here you see if your tests have passed or failed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423783-58bf2008-514e-4f96-9c12-c9a55703960c.png"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:21px;"><strong>Viewing Test Logs</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Clicking on the workflow run shows you all the actions that GitHub performed and clicking on Run Playwright tests shows the error messages, what was expected and what was received as well as the call log.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183423783-58bf2008-514e-4f96-9c12-c9a55703960c.png"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:21px;"><strong>HTML Report</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The HTML Report shows you a full report of your tests. You can filter the report by browsers, passed tests, failed tests, skipped tests, and flaky tests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:19px;"><strong>Downloading the HTML Report</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the Artifacts section, click on the playwright-report to download your report in the format of a zip file.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13063165/183437023-524f1803-84e4-4862-9ce3-1d55af0e023e.png"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:19px;"><strong>Viewing the HTML Report</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Locally opening the report does not work as expected as you need a web server for everything to work correctly. First, extract the zip, preferably in a folder that already has Playwright installed. Using the command line, change into the directory where the report is and use npx playwright show-report followed by the name of the extracted folder. This serves up the report and enables you to view it in your browser.</p><pre><code>npx playwright show-report name-of-my-extracted-playwright-report</code></pre><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/c5f60e56-fb75-4a2d-a4b6-054b8c5d69c1"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:19px;"><strong>Viewing the Trace</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have served the report using npx playwright show-report, click on the trace icon next to the test's file name as seen in the image above. You can then view the trace of your tests and inspect each action to try to find out why the tests are failing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/assets/13063165/10fe3585-8401-4051-b1c2-b2e92ac4c274"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span style="font-size:19px;"><strong>Publishing report on the web</strong></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Downloading the HTML report as a zip file is not very convenient. However, we can utilize Azure Storage's static websites hosting capabilities to easily and efficiently serve HTML reports on the Internet, requiring minimal configuration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Create an Azure Storage account.</li><li>Enable Static website hosting for the storage account.</li></ol><p>Create a Service Principal in Azure and grant it access to Azure Blob storage. Upon successful execution, the command will display the credentials which will be used in the next step.</p><pre><code>az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-actions" --role "Storage Blob Data Contributor" --scopes /subscriptions/&lt;SUBSCRIPTION_ID&gt;/resourceGroups/&lt;RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME&gt;/providers/Microsoft.Storage
/storageAccounts/&lt;STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME&gt;</code></pre><ol><li>Use the credentials from the previous step to set up encrypted secrets in your GitHub repository. Go to your repository's settings, under GitHub Actions secrets, and add the following secrets:<br>AZCOPY_SPA_APPLICATION_ID</li></ol><ul><li>AZCOPY_SPA_CLIENT_SECRET</li><li>AZCOPY_TENANT_ID</li></ul><ol><li>Add a step that uploads the HTML report to Azure Storage.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><pre><code class="js javascript js-code">// .github/workflows/playwright.yml

They can contain sensitive data like user credentials for a test user, access tokens to a staging backend, testing source code, or sometimes even your application source code. Treat these files just as carefully as you treat that sensitive data. If you upload reports and traces as part of your CI workflow, make sure that you only upload them to trusted artifact stores, or that you encrypt the files before upload. The same is true for sharing artifacts with team members: Use a trusted file share or encrypt the files before sharing.</p>
